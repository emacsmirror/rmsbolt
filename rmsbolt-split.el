;;; Commentary:

;; This is a small library for editing command line parameters, passed as
;; a string. For example, given:
;; gcc -o one two -c -S
;; This library tries to make it possible to remove '-o one' '-c' and '-S'.
;;
;; This is not easy to do without bugs, and therefore this is mostly incomplete.
;; Hopefully we will never see more complicated formats (such as quoted arguments)
;; in generated commands, or we will need to write a parser.

;;; Requires:

(require 'cl-lib)

;;; Variables

(defvar rmsbolt-split--regexp (rx (1+ blank)))

;;; Code:

(defun rmsbolt-split-rm-single (cmd flag)
  "Remove a single FLAG from CMD."
  (let ((cmd (split-string cmd rmsbolt-split--regexp)))
    (mapconcat
     #'identity
     (cl-remove-if (apply-partially #'string= flag) cmd)
     " ")))

(defun rmsbolt-split-rm-double (cmd flag)
  "Remove a single FLAG and arg from CMD."
  (let ((cmd (split-string cmd rmsbolt-split--regexp))
        (removed nil))
    (mapconcat
     #'identity
     (cl-remove-if (lambda (f)
                     (cond
                      ((string= f flag)
                       (setq removed t))
                      (removed
                       (setq removed nil)
                       t)
                      (t nil)))
                   cmd)
     " ")))

(provide 'rmsbolt-split)
