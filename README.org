A supercharged implementation of the [[https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer][godbolt compiler-explorer]] for Emacs.

RMSbolt tries to make it easy to see what your compiler is doing. It does this
by showing you the assembly output of a given source code file. It also
highlights which source code a given assembly block corresponds to, and vice
versa. It supports more types of languages than any previous tool of its kind.

* [[file:doc/rmsbolt.org][Documentation]]

This README is a condensed version of the docs. [[file:doc/rmsbolt.org][For full usage instructions,
please start at the docs (also available through info).]]

* Why RMSbolt over godbolt?

- Much more flexible and powerful:
  - Supports disassembly to bytecode as well as assembly.
  - Supports many languages that godbolt does not support, such as Python, PHP,
    Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Ocaml, Java, and Pony.
  - Allows targeting custom compilers - which means disassembly for niche
    assembly targets, specific commits of compilers, and patched libraries or
    compilers is possible.
- No more sending your code to any server.
- Much faster turnaround time from writing code to seeing and interacting with disassembly.
- 100% usable without the mouse.
- Runs entirely without node, npm, or js:
  - No required dependencies other than Emacs 25 and your compiler ~:)~
  - It's easy to add new languages (even those that use unique bytecode formats)
    without touching many files.
  - Dosen't eat your ram on the 'server' or the 'client'.
  - No enforced limits on code size, compilation time, or processing time.
- Benefits from living in Emacs:
  - Full undo tree from Emacs on disassembly/source so you don't lose work.
  - Vim bindings through evil/viper.
  - Use compile.el, flymake, or flycheck to traverse and fix errors as you
    would normally.
  - Use *any* libraries on your machine trivially.
  - Customize colors and behavior through ~customize~.
  - Change tracking through magit/diff-hl/etc.
  - Nyans are fully supported with [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode][nyan-mode]].
- Simpler.
- Infinitely hackable!

* Installation

rmsbolt will almost certainly not work naively on windows as it depends on a
unix shell for building the compilation commands. It may work through cygwin
though.

** Melpa

[[http://melpa.org/#/rmsbolt][A melpa package is available for rmsbolt]].

** Quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (quelpa '(rmsbolt
            :files (:defaults "starters")
            :fetcher gitlab
            :repo "jgkamat/rmsbolt"))
#+END_SRC

* Running
Once installed, use the ~rmsbolt-starter~ command to generate starter files, or
enable ~rmsbolt-mode~ in a supported language. Then run ~rmsbolt-compile~ or
use the default ~C-c C-c~ binding. After the first run, the buffer should
automatically update.

Language-specific quirks are listed in the full documentation.

* Configuration

RMSbolt is primarily configured with Emacs local variables. This lets you change
compiler and rmsbolt options simply by editing a local variable block. The
starter files have this block with some common settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  // Local Variables:
  // rmsbolt-command: "gcc -O0"
  // rmsbolt-disassemble: nil
  // End:
#+END_SRC

*Note*: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables][the Local Variable block must be 3000 characters from the end of the
file to work]]. Any method of setting buffer-local variables will work though.

The main knobs are described in the full documentation.
