* [[https://gitlab.com/jgkamat/rmsbolt][RMSbolt]] [[https://melpa.org/#/rmsbolt][file:https://melpa.org/packages/rmsbolt-badge.svg]]

A supercharged implementation of the [[https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer][godbolt compiler-explorer]] for Emacs.

RMSBolt tries to make it easy to see what your compiler is doing. It does this
by showing you the assembly output of a given source code file. It also
highlights which source code a given assembly block corresponds to, and vice
versa. It supports more types of languages than any previous tool of its kind.

* Why RMSbolt over godbolt?

- Much more flexible and powerful:
  - Supports disassembly to bytecode as well as assembly.
  - Supports many languages that godbolt does not support, such as Python,
    Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Ocaml, Java, and Pony.
- No more sending your code to any server.
- Much faster turnaround time from writing code to seeing and interacting with disassembly.
- 100% usable without the mouse.
- Runs entirely without node, npm, or js:
  - No required dependencies other than Emacs 25 and your compiler ~:)~
  - It's easy to add new languages (even those that use unique bytecode formats)
    without touching many files.
  - Dosen't eat your ram on the 'server' or the 'client'.
  - No enforced limits on code size, compilation time, or processing time.
- Benefits from living in Emacs:
  - Full undo tree from Emacs on disassembly/source so you don't loose work.
  - Vim bindings through evil/viper.
  - Use compile.el, flymake, or flycheck to traverse and fix errors as you
    would normally.
  - Use *any* libraries on your machine trivially.
  - Customize colors and behavior through ~customize~.
  - Change tracking through magit/diff-hl/etc.
  - Nyans are fully supported with [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode][nyan-mode]].
- Simpler.
- Infinitely hackable!

* Installation

rmsbolt will almost certainly not work naively on windows as it depends on a
unix shell for building the compilation commands. It may work through cygwin
though.

** Melpa

[[http://melpa.org/#/rmsbolt][A melpa package is available for rmsbolt]].

** Quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (quelpa '(rmsbolt
            :files (:defaults "starters")
            :fetcher gitlab
            :repo "jgkamat/rmsbolt"))
#+END_SRC

* Running
Once installed, use the ~rmsbolt-starter~ command to generate starter files, or
enable ~rmsbolt-mode~ in a supported language. Then run ~rmsbolt-compile~ or
use the default ~C-c C-c~ binding. After the first run, the buffer should
automatically update.

Language-specific quirks are listed in the demos section currently.

* Configuration

RMSBolt is primarily configured with Emacs local variables. This lets you change
compiler and rmsbolt options simply by editing a local variable block. The
starter files have this block with some common settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
// Local Variables:
// rmsbolt-command: "gcc -O0"
// rmsbolt-disassemble: nil
// End:
#+END_SRC

*Note*: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables][the Local Variable block must be 3000 characters from the end of the
file to work]]. Any method of setting buffer-local variables will work though.

Notable options:

| Option                        | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~rmsbolt-command~             | determines the prefix of the compilation command to use. Use this to switch between compilers or pass flags to your compiler. |
| ~rmsbolt-disassemble~         | disassemble from a compiled binary with objdump, if supported.                                                                |
| ~rmsbolt-filter-*~            | Tweak filtering of binary output                                                                                              |
| ~rmsbolt-intel-x86~           | Toggle between intel and att syntax if supported                                                                              |
| ~rmsbolt-demangle~            | Demangle the output, if supported.                                                                                            |
| ~rmsbolt-ignore-binary-limit~ | Ignore the binary size limit for disassembly. This will almost certainly cause Emacs to hang during large processing.         |

* Demos
** C/C++

** OCaml

[[https://i.imgur.com/369Ylxk.gif][https://i.imgur.com/369Ylxk.gif]]

** Rust

demangling is done with rustfilt if available

[[https://i.imgur.com/nW1lVFM.gif][https://i.imgur.com/nW1lVFM.gif]]

** Haskell

demangling is done with the compiler-explorer demangler, named
to ~haskell-demangler~.

[[https://i.imgur.com/fAQQMJe.gif][https://i.imgur.com/fAQQMJe.gif]]

** Python

Support for viewing bytecode only. Python [[https://bugs.python.org/issue2506][doesn't have many options]], so most
tweakables will not work. Python 3.7 is required for recursion into functions,
otherwise only top level code will be shown. Python 2 is unsupported.

[[https://i.imgur.com/cMYfkGx.gif][https://i.imgur.com/cMYfkGx.gif]]

** Java

Parses the output of ~javap~, so may be a little unreliable or buggy at the
moment.

[[https://i.imgur.com/KkWEMMj.gif][https://i.imgur.com/KkWEMMj.gif]]

** Pony

Filtering on pony is not as effective as pony asm includes references to
machine-generated functions. This means the output will be slower to generate,
similar to disassembly in other languages. The pony file being viewed will be
copied into it's own directory, making it much harder to view non-toy examples.

** Emacs Lisp

No support for source->asm matching, filtering, or automatic recompile.

Emacs 26 or the ~cl-print~ package are required.

[[https://i.imgur.com/uYrQ7En.gif][https://i.imgur.com/uYrQ7En.gif]]

** Common Lisp

No support for source->asm matching or filtering. Only ~sbcl~ and ~clisp~
supported at the moment, with ~sbcl~ giving much better results.

* Adding a Language

Adding support for a new language is fairly easy. The closer it is to existing
compilers, the easier it will be (to the point where a clone of a C compiler is
just a couple copy-paste lines). However, it is not excessively hard to add
support for completely foreign compilers and bytecode/assembly formats.

As a minimum starting point, you must know how to compile a source file to
assembly or bytecode on the command line, and know how the line numbers are
available in the compiled form if they exist.

1. [[file:rmsbolt.el::;;;;%20Language%20Definitions][Add a new entry to the language definitions statement.]]
   - To do this, you will need to (at a minimum) add a mode, compile-command, a
     compile-cmd-function, and a starter file name.
   - The compile-cmd-function is a function that will turn local variable
     settings into a valid command which will take in a filename and output
     assembly or an executable. See ~rmsbolt--c-compile-cmd~ for an example.
   - If the assembly is not in a standard format, you will need to define a
     ~process-asm-custom-fn~ as well (see python/java for examples).
2. [[file:rmsbolt.el::;;;;;%20Starter%20Definitions][Add a new entry into the starter file]]
   - For this, you will need to make a starter file. See [[file:starters/][this folder]] for
     existing examples.

You're done!
